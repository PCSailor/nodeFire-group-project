<!-- Pro Mode
Your site needs another view. Create a second route and view on the front end that is available only to users who are authenticated. Examples:

If a user logs in, they will see a link to a users view. Ideally, this route will be /#/users
If a user is not logged in and attempts to navigate to /#/admin, they should be redirected to the login page -->



<ul>
  <li><a href="#!users">User Data</a></li>
  <li><a href="#!admin">Administrator</a></li>
</ul>
